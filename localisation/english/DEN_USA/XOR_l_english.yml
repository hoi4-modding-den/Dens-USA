 XOR_events.0.desc:0 "The last letter came on December 19th, 1935. In it contained a report stating the dissolution of the Oregon Government, and the assumption of power by the armed forces. The paper assured us that democracy would return, one day. After order had been restored. I remember reading that letter, shaking my head, and throwing it away. There hasn't been any more letters after that.\n\nBeing a part of the now defunct Oregon Government, I never returned home in fear of arrest at the arms of the Junta. I mearly prayed for my fellow men, and hoped for the best. But things have changed, and the longer I wait the more concerned I am for the safety of my state. Even though the letters have stopped, that doesn't mean I have to give up. I must know what is going on.\n\n     -Senator Charles McNary"
 XOR_events.0.a:0 "Alis Volat Propriis"

 XOR_events.1.t:0 "The First Step"
 XOR_events.1.desc:0 "McNary may have had idea for what to expect, but this wasn't it. He nearly bankrupted himself gathering enough people for his cause of restoring democracy to Oregon, never mind the bribes it took for him to enter and stay in Washington. He at least expected the citizens of Oregon to recognize and maybe even cheer him on on his quest.\n\nBut there were no people.\n\nNot a person could be seen in Umatilla, no matter how hard he and his followers tried. It was empty.\nHowever, McNary couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong. Even though everybody had seemingly vanished, the town remained in perfect condition. Electricity was still on, there was no evidence of looting or rioting. Someone even ran across a bakery, still stocked with warm pastries. Its like the citizens of Umatilla had been turned into ghosts."
 XOR_events.1.a:0 "Well, at least this will make a good base."

 XOR_events.2.t:0 "Investigative team returns from Pendleton"
 XOR_events.2.desc:0 "The 3rd Investigative Unit has returned from their brief expedition to Pendleton, and to the relief of the O.I.D. without harm. In their breifing, they relay a sad but similar tale. It seems that similar to Umatilla, the residents of Pendleton are also missing.\n\nHowever, further down the report a set of three notes would turn the whole report upside down. A small group of investigators tasked to the southern outskirts of the city found a ruined pick-up vehicle to the side of the road. Though this vehicle was unlike anything anybody had ever seen. Painted bright red, with massive headlights and a sort of sleekness nobody had ever seen. On the front lay the words "Toyota", which was later determined to be a Japanese automobile company. But they were a puny company across the pacific, how could a vehicle make it over to Pendleton?? Even now nobody could give an answer, though some are calling this "Toyota Tacoma" a futuristic alien wreck."
 XOR_events.2.a:0 "An empty town with futuristic cars..."

 XOR_events.3.t:0 "Investigative team returns from Bend"
 XOR_events.3.desc:0 "The 1st Investigative Unit has returned from Bend, a bit bruised but intact. Their report came with some surprises, no doubt. As the team was passing through Redmond, on the outskirts of Bend, they were surprised by the sounds of machinery. It was the sounds of a working factory! The 1st Unit immediately changed course to investigate, and located the source at a local arms factory in Redmond. However, when they entered the facility, they found (as they described) nothing short of magic Machinery whirred, metal was refined and molded, yet not a man could be seen in the factory. They called it ghosts, no less!\n\nFurther searching through Redmond gave similar results, but due to the delays and material shortage the unit had to return to base before they could enter Bend itself. Though with these findings, demand for another investigation to Bend is high, to figure out what is really happening."

 XOR_events.6.t:0 "Second Investigative team returns from Bend"
 XOR_events.6.desc:0 "The 2nd Investigative Unit has returned from Bend, and with them came a bombshell of information. The report first validated the previous investigations claims, verifying that Redmond was indeed a functioning "ghost" city. However, that paled in comparison to what came next. The Unit reports that the city of Bend is not only functining, but alive! Multiple photos and letters confirm that the citizens of Bend did not disappear. Though there was still no shortage of weird occurances. Interviews with some of the civilians claim that people have traveled to and from parts of Oregon we see as empty. Steelworkers claiming to have traveled back from work in Redmond. It entirely contradicts what is in front of our eyes\n\nThis report completely changes the game, Oregon is alive! Though this requires further investigation."
 XOR_events.6.a:0 "At least Oregon is no longer depopulated."

 XOR_events.4.t:0 "Investigative team returns from the High Desert"
 XOR_events.4.desc:0 "The 3rd Investigative Unit has returned from Southern Oregon, intact but seemingly off. Their report is nothing short of fantastical, but they claim it to be the truth.\n\nThey claim, supposedly, that they found a series of §Bmassive irrigated farmland§! around the desert town of Burns. That is impossible, however, that area has historically been a massive desert and has no capability to host that scale of agriculture. What is even weirder, they claim that §B50,000§! people lived in the town of Burns! Its insane, but the Unit unanimously believes their claims. Its crazy, but this unit is known for their upmost loyalty. They wouldn't fake a report like this?"
 XOR_events.4.a:0 "Investigate no further, we have greater concerns."

 XOR_events.5.desc:0 "With numerous successful missions, the O.I.D. has declared the Oregon East secured, and now works towards rebuilding and further expanding their control. So far the O.I.D. has only operated as a supranational organization, with little effort put in to directly managing and governing the state. But McNary wishes to change that. Even with the existing mysteries still surrounding the state, McNary believes it is time to start anew, and rebuild the old Oregon systems.\n\nThere is still much work to be done, but the Oregon dream is not yet gone."
