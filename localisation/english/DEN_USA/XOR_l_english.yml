 #Events

 XOR_events.0.desc:0 "The last letter came on December 19th, 1935. In it contained a report stating the dissolution of the Oregon Government, and the assumption of power by the armed forces. The paper assured us that democracy would return, one day. After order had been restored. I remember reading that letter, shaking my head, and throwing it away. There hasn't been any more letters after that.\n\nBeing a part of the now defunct Oregon Government, I never returned home in fear of arrest at the arms of the Junta. I mearly prayed for my fellow men, and hoped for the best. But things have changed, and the longer I wait the more concerned I am for the safety of my state. Even though the letters have stopped, that doesn't mean I have to give up. I must know what is going on.\n\n     -Senator Charles McNary"

He nearly bankrupted himself gathering enough people for his cause of restoring democracy to Oregon, never mind the bribes it took for him to enter and stay in Washington. He at least expected the citizens of Oregon to recognize and maybe even cheer him on on his quest.\n\nBut there were no people.\n\nNot a person could be seen in Umatilla, no matter how hard he and his followers tried. It was empty.\nHowever, McNary couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong. Even though everybody had seemingly vanished, the town remained in perfect condition. Electricity was still on, there was no evidence of looting or rioting. Someone even ran across a bakery, still stocked with warm pastries. Its like the citizens of Umatilla had been turned into ghosts."
 XOR_events.1.t.a:0 "Well, at least this will make a good base."
