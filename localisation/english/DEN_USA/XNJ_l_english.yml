 XNJ_description:0 "After the collapse of the union, New Jersey was split into many factions, each controlling only a few towns or cities. Rising to the top was ISCAP, the International Society of Composers and Producers. Now a safehaven of creation, performence, and expression in (almost) all forms, the land controlled by the Society must learn how to defend itself, or fall to the other growing factions in the former states."
